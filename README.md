# CFAv2

This code base was developed for an independent project in collaboration with the CFA(Center for Astrophysics at Harvard) in order to detect promising transits in the kepler k2 time series data. It is an ongoing project that shows promise. A potential paper in the Spring is to come, so stay tuned!
