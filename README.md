# CFAv2

This code base was developed as an independent project in collaboration with the [CFA](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/)(Center for Astrophysics at Harvard) in order to detect promising transits in the kepler k2 time series data using CNNs. It is an ongoing project that shows promise. A potential paper in the Spring is to come, so stay tuned!

On [Kaggle's transit dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/nasa/kepler-exoplanet-search-results), it has reached a 98% accuracy.
On real, unfiltered data (using an end-to-end methodology), it has reached around 75% accuracy on the binary classification task.
